         <p>The guidance for overseas applicants and sponsors outlines the significance of BRPs as proof of the right to stay, work, or study in the UK. It emphasizes that BRPs can be used for identification purposes, including opening bank accounts in the UK. Additionally, it provides information on right-to-work checks for employers and the importance of statutory defence against penalties for employing individuals without the right to work in the UK </p>

         <p>This guidance offers detailed information about BRPs and Biometric Residence Cards (BRCs). BRPs and BRCs contain biographic and biometric details, indicating the holder's immigration status and entitlements while in the UK. They can be used to confirm identity when opening bank accounts, accessing public services, and demonstrating rights to study or work in the UK. Some categories of immigration may include the holder's National Insurance Number on the document </p>

         <p>An essential step for international students and employees moving to the UK is applying for a National Insurance (NI) number. The NI number is unique to each individual and is necessary for legal employment, claiming benefits, applying for a student loan, and paying voluntary National Insurance contributions. Applicants need to apply for an NI number if it is not already printed on their BRP and if they do not already possess one. The application process involves verifying one's identity and eligibility to work in the UK, and it is a crucial step for individuals looking to settle in the country and participate in various official processes</p>
